# Brazil-Medical-Appointments-Analysis
The project focus on the data from 100k medical appointments in Brazi and analyze what attributions would affect the patients who show up for their appointments.
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file, which is used to perform data analysis and data visualization. The notebook is designed to work with a specific dataset or problem statement, and can be used to explore and analyze the data in an interactive manner.

## Summary of Findings
By analyzing five variables SMS_recerived, Scholarship, days differences between the scheduled day and appointment day, neighborhoods, and age, we could conclude that the period differences between the scheduled day and appointment day and age of patients are two factors most likely to affect the attendance of appointments. The longer gap between the scheduled day and appointment day, the larger chance of patients not showing up to the appointments. And younger patients aged between 9 to 25 have a higher percentage of missing appointments than the patients in middle age.
